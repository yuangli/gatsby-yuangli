I learnt and practiced new technologies on both design and development aspects from the experience.\nFor eoko app specifically, this is a two week design and development sprint. My job in the team is to remap the user experience of the app based on the existed features, and redesign the user interfaces with usability testing. Since this project had a relatively clear business plan and a lot marketing researches, my first job is to help the company identity the goal of the Minimum viable product. I spent time talking with business and marketing in the company.\nTogether, we filled out the project canvas, business canvas and UX Questionnaires, which gave me a better knowledges on the target audience and competitive applications. I had some couple long talks with my co-workers about the researches had been done. Another than that, I had done a lot of researches on the ecosystem of the accelerator, and interviewed people at the incubator of Drexel University."
